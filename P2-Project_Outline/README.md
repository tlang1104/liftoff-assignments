## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here

To create an tool/search engine/database/environment for motorcycle owners who ride/own/repair, older motorcycles.  Thought it will be for everyone.  The primary focus will be on older motorcycles that are non HD.  Specific bikes and parts are hard to find.  As well as the sites carrying the info are not very search friendly.  Mostly because these sites/places carry no IT people and loop through auto set up sites.


### Features
Include Features here

1. Create a profile that will hold info on members/users. This should tie in and associate motorcycle styles, locations, and other common aspects of users

2. Community available to users to share info, experiences and general motorcycle social conversation. Probably blog style.

3. Part/motorcycle specific search engine.  There are few places to look for items on the internet that are up to date and kept locations.  This will include items from dealerships, parts vendors, salvage yards.  If you are looking for a specific motorcycle or part.  A lot of these places you have to go to there sites to search.  Just to google that motorcycle or item.  These places will be in the far back pages of your search.  I will have to link/store data somehow for better access.

4. Part association.  A lot of older parts are obsolete.  Though there may be another part that works for that item.  But it will have different part numbers and are hard to tie together.  There is also a general knowledge where someone has used a different part or accessories that works in place of the obsolete item that is not manufactured tracked.

5. Specific data base for hard to find info/people to help your issues.  The motorcycle community is mostly word of mouth.  You live in an environment outdoors and away from technology and communications.  That environment is changing and riders need to have a place they can search for help.  There are a lot of home garage mechanics, parts holders, salvage yards, painters, builders.  That mostly work on side because the are asked through known associates.  These will be a consistent growing database that can be updated via user profile to hopefully tie those areas together.

6. Job tracker. I would like to create a tracker that is job specific.  Example: "Change oil on 2002 VTX1800S", this will crete a layout of what needs to be done to perform that job and track you working through it.  This will also Tie users to that job so users struggling to complete can inquire to other users who has completed that job.

### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here


There are multiple things I am going to have to lear.  I want to do blog style community. We did bolg assignment but it was in python.  I will have to learn to convert.  More data base building.  This will be a pretty intense user, info, tracking, multifaceted data base.  I don't even know how to start setting it up and tying everything together.
